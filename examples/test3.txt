bad experience!! the cost of xmas day lunch was Â£62.50 each almost double what others were charging so we had high expectations. WE WERE WRONG. the starters my daughter and I had were brie which was passable [well you can,t mess up brie can you?] my wife had the melon which made her violently ill! [more of that later]. When the main course arrived we were asked almost immediately if everything was all right. out of politeness we all said yes even though we had not yet tasted any of it. In fact MOST of mine was very poor. starting with my beef which had a large vein of gristle running through both pieces making it largely inedible ,the brussels were soggy,the "roasted potatoes were all the same size and colour meaning they were probably bought from the freezer aisle of some supermarket and the peas were dried due to being heated after cooking. All this was followed by some brown mud they laughingly called christmas pudding accompanied by some insipid custard which tasted only vaguely of brandy. I may sound like I am being overly critical but I honestly found EVERY ITEM on my plates was inferior in one way or another. Also I had to ask for my coffee cup to be changed because it had lipstick on it! I called the next day to complain and to inform them that I had been informed of an out break of salmonella had been reported in the East Midlands and it was connected to MELONS! I am NOT suggesting that was the case with my wife but it was certainly the melons that she vomited up first! she was ill for 3 days. when I mentioned this to the man I spoke to [a manager he said] his reply was "well nobody else has complained" He told me a woman called Zoe would be very upset to hear about my complaints and would be calling me. I have to say that as of today [3rd january] no such call has been received by me. i also told him I was not asking for a discount and also would not be leaving a bad review on the internet. HOWEVER due to the lack of a follow up call I feel compelled to leave this review .If anyone is interested the "melon" article was in the independent news paper some time in december 18. In conclusion I will say that for 3 meals and 3 beers I spent over 200 QUID!! It wasn,t worth even half of that. we have voted with our feet!!
