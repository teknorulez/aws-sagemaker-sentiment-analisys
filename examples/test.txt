Clean, nice staff, building a bit tired
Stayed with my partner for 3 nights. Staff really lovely and chatty. Building is old - and thus rather quirky and some of the communal areas are a bit dated - not really suitable for people with mobility needs due to the various steps. Plenty of parking available. Our room was spotlessly clean, and everything worked as expected and the Wi-fi worked really well. The building generally was old and tired. However, the room itself (we had 106) looked recently decorated albeit, the bathroom fittings and shower were tired (but clean!). I would happily stay again, and I would consider myself fussy towards cleanliness. The breakfast was nice, but would benefit from a different brand/better quality of sausage. Again, perhaps me being a bit picky? Thanks for a nice stay. Would stay here again.
