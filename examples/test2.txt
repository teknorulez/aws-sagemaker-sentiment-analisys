New owners Laura & Adam made my daughter's day wonderful. From allowing us unlimited time the day before to dress the room through the excellent service and food at the wedding breakfast and on into the evening party we has nothing but praise for the service, attitude and friendliness of all the staff and special mention to the DJ who had us up dancing all night. We had our Shi tzu dog as a page boy and he was welcomed at the hotel (but not in the function room) and was very comfortable in our hotel room. We stayed overnight and had a nice breakfast in the morning before departing to nice cheery comments from the staff on duty this morning. Already rebooked for my 60th in Dec 2020!
